/**
 * This is one of the conflict resolution strategy in which we start with an empty set $E$ of enabled constraints.
 * We add constraints incrementally in order of descending priority so that $E$ is conflict-free,
 * until all non-conflicting constraints have been added
 * Iterating through the constraints, we add each constraint tentatively to $E$ (``enabling'' it), and try to solve the resulting specification.
 * Note that whenever a constraint is added, the pivot assignment needs to be recalculated.
 * If a solution is found, we proceed to the next constraint.
 * If no solution is found, the tentatively added constraint is removed again.
 * In that case, the previous solution is restored and we proceed to the next constraint.
